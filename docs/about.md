# About BITE

This Battery Intrade Trading Engine is the simulation code base for the paper (tbd) by Schaurecker et al. (2025). The base code is written in C++ and wrapped in Python for ease of use. Further features might be added in the near future, and this documentation will be updated accordingly.

This code is written by David Schaurecker, and is based on the work of his co-authors and himself. The Python code is open-source and can be used by anyone, but please cite the paper if you use it in your own work. We are happy to receive feedback and suggestions for improvement!
